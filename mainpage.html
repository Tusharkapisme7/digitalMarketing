        <h3>The Compendium</h3>
        <p class="description">“India’s soft power, a blend of its rich cultural tapestry and educational prowess, commands attention and respect both domestically and internationally as is actively debated in both the popular and the intellectual spheres, some aspects perhaps more often than others. A nation of more than 1.4 billion people takes pride in its Sportspersons and Musicians, Entrepreneurs and Writers, Business Leaders and Dancers, Scientists and Artists, Economists and Techies, Astronauts and Academics alike, all products of India’s culture of education and beacons of its soft power.

            This volume, the first in a series curated by the Jagdish Sheth School of Management (JAGSoM), shines a spotlight on a distinct aspect of India’s soft power: Scholars and Educators of Indian origin who have left an indelible mark on the global academic landscape. Whether operating within India or on foreign soil, these individuals exemplify the country’s intellectual contributions to global business and management education. This compendium not only honours their professional achievements but also delves into the personal journeys and philosophies that have shaped their path to leadership.”</p>
